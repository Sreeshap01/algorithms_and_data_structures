I tried the problem in a couple of ways, and analysed the time and space complexities by changing the data types, reducing the number of variables stored (eg: if a calcualtion result is used only once, just use te calculation directly as the input instead of storing it etc), and by running thr timeit functions on each solution.Overall the experience and the learning was quite good as it showed how important is each line of code and its implications in terms of time and space complexity.\n",

Finally it showed how important is to format and comment the code well, so another person can understand it well."
